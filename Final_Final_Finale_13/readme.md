All the library has been included in the project folder. 

To build the project, run the build.bat file in each folder. Then compile the standalone getParameter.cpp file.

Run getParameter.exe to generate the parameter.txt file for the client. Then modify the first line into client's ip address.

Copy the paremeter.txt from the Server folder into the folder that contains the .exe file and modify the first line into client's ip address.

Run client.exe first, it will open the port and waiting for the connection. Then run server.exe and it will connect to client if everything setup correctly.
